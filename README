= Diff Longest Common Sub String Gem documentation

-- The diff sniffing out texts every move

A resonably fast diff algoritm using longest common substrings that
can also find text that has moved.

PositionRange is a library by the LogiLogi Foundation, extracted from
http://www.logilogi.org (http://foundation.logilogi.org).

== Usage

First require it.

  $ irb

  > require 'rubygems'
  > require 'difflcs'

Then it can be used on any set of arrays, in this example 123456789
and 120678934, of which the first '12' overlaps, '0' is new, '34' has 
moved to the end, and '6789' overlaps too, but moved 2 positions to
the left.

NOTE: They are arrays, not strings.

  > DiffLCS.diff('123456789'.split(''), '120678934'.split('')) 
  => {
       :matched_old=>[0...2, 5...9, 2...4],
       :matched_new=>[0...2, 3...7, 7...9]
     }

As you see it can sniff out text that has moved too.

A minimum overlap size can be provided for speed purposes, and to
prevent too many matches;

  > DiffLCS.diff('123456789'.split(''), '120678934'.split(''), :minimum_lcs_size => 3)
  => {
       :matched_old => PositionRange::List.from_s('5,9'),
       :matched_new => PositionRange::List.from_s('3,7')
     }

Diff can be called directly on strings too, if 'diff_l_c_s/string' is required.

  > require 'diff_l_c_s/string'
  > '123'.diff('321')
  => {
       :matched_old=>[2...3, 1...2, 0...1],
       :matched_new=>[0...1, 1...2, 2...3]
     }
